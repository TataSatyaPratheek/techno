## Audio Development Guidelines

When working with audio generation:

- **Sample rates**: Use 44100 Hz as default
- **Bit depth**: Use 16-bit PCM for WAV files
- **Normalization**: Keep audio levels between -1.0 and 1.0
- **Performance**: Optimize for real-time generation where possible
- **Testing**: Use short durations for automated tests

## Pull Request Process

1. **Ensure CI passes** - All tests and linting must pass
2. **Update documentation** - README, CHANGELOG, etc.
3. **Squash commits** - Combine related commits into logical units
4. **Write clear PR description** - Explain what and why
5. **Request review** - Tag maintainers for review

## Issue Reporting

When reporting bugs:

- Use the issue template
- Include Python version, OS, and dependency versions
- Provide minimal reproduction case
- Include error messages and stack traces
- Describe expected vs. actual behavior

## Feature Requests

For new features:

- Check existing issues first
- Describe the use case clearly
- Explain why it's needed
- Consider implementation complexity
- Be open to alternative solutions

## Recognition

Contributors will be recognized in:
- CHANGELOG.md for significant contributions
- GitHub repository contributors list
- Project documentation
